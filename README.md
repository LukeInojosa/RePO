You need to install git-lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/) to be able to download the pre-trained models.
After installing git-lfs you can just get this repo by using this command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/S-Mohammad-Hashemi/SST.git
```
Do not download the zip file from the GitHub's website directly. It doesn't download the pretrained-models.
